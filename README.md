<h1 align="center">Stock-Predictions</h1>

## Motivations
Incorporating finance/accounting concepts and time-series forecasting, this Jupyter Notebook attempts to leverage a range of forecasting techniques like LSTM, ARIMA and RNN to predict stock prices as well as company financials (balance sheet, income statement and cash flow) to determine whether a company's stock has a buy or sell potential. To obtain the company financials, a BeautifulSoup webscrapper is used on the Yahoo Finance website.
